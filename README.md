## Library Roulette
Library Roulette is a simple game to play in the libaryr or in a quiet, crowded place. Pass it aruond the table and have each person simply hit the button. If the screen flashed green, you're safe! If the screen flashes red, be prepared for a loud sound! For best experience, use a device with loud speakers. **DO NOT USE WITH HEADPHONES!**
